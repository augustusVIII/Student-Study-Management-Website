🚀 FEATURES
-----------
• Assignment Tracker – View, add, and manage assignments and deadlines  
• Class Collaboration – See what classmates are working on and share notes  
• Personal Dashboard – Track progress visually using charts and status bars   
• Deadline Reminders – Email and in-app notifications    
• Secure Login – Session-based authentication system  


🛠️ TECH STACK
--------------
Backend: Python (Flask)  
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap  
Database: SQLite (local) / PostgreSQL (deployment)  
Hosting: Render / Railway (planned)  


🧩 PROJECT ARCHITECTURE
-----------------------
Flask App  →  Routes  →  Models (SQLite)  
Flask App → Templates (Jinja2) →  Static Assets (CSS / JS)  

🧠 HOW IT WORKS
